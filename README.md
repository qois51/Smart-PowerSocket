# ⚡ Smart Power Socket: IoT-Based Energy Monitoring & Control
Smart Power Socket is an intelligent IoT energy management system designed to monitor electricity usage in real-time and enforce consumption limits through an automated energy quota-based cutoff mechanism.

## 🌟 Key Features
 - Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks Voltage (V), Current (A), Active Power (W), Frequency (Hz), and Power Factor (PF).
- Quota Management: Automatically disconnects the power supply via a relay once the pre-allocated energy quota reaches zero.
- Dual Dashboards: Separate interfaces for Users (monitoring & local control) and Admins (quota top-up & management).
- Secure Global Access: Utilizes Cloudflare Tunneling to provide secure remote access over the public internet without port forwarding.
- Local Status Indicator: Integrated LCD I2C display for immediate visual feedback on WiFi connectivity and relay status.
